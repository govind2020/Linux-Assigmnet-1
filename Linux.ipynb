        "\n",
        "- Linux is a free and open-source operating system  that manages a computer's hardware and software. It's a widely used OS, powering everything from personal computers to servers and even mobile devices. Linux is known for its flexibility, security, and reliability.\n",

        "2. What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A hard link always points a filename to data on a storage device. A soft link always points a filename to another filename, which then points to information on a storage device\n",

        "3.  What is a Kernel in Linux?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Linux, the kernel is the core of the operating system, acting as the bridge between hardware and software. It manages system resources, handles low-level tasks, and allows the OS to interact with the underlying hardware.\n",

        "\n",

        "- Set a password: After creating the user, set a password with the passwd command: sudo passwd username.\n",
        "- Optional: Add to groups: You can add the user to specific groups using usermod\n",
